# @oasty/downgrader

Downgrade [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/) documents one minor version at a time: 3.2 → 3.1 and 3.1 → 3.0. Each converter works on an entire document or on a single Schema Object.

- **Never throws**: malformed parts are deep-copied through unchanged instead of failing the whole conversion, and cyclic object graphs (e.g. the output of a `$ref` dereferencer) don't recurse forever — a subtree that cycles back into an ancestor is deep-copied with its cycle preserved instead of converted. Only pathologically deep nesting (thousands of levels) can still exhaust the call stack.
- **Never mutates**: the input document is left untouched.
- **Extension-preserving, never extension-inventing**: existing `x-` keys and unknown keys always survive, while constructs the target version cannot express are converted where an equivalent exists and removed otherwise.

## Usage

```ts
import {
  downgradeSchemaV31ToV30,
  downgradeSchemaV32ToV31,
  downgradeSpecV31ToV30,
  downgradeSpecV32ToV31,
} from "@oasty/downgrader";

const v31 = downgradeSpecV32ToV31(v32Document);
const v30 = downgradeSpecV31ToV30(v31Document);

// There is intentionally no direct 3.2 → 3.0 converter; compose the steps:
const downgraded = downgradeSpecV31ToV30(downgradeSpecV32ToV31(v32Document));

// Schema Objects can be converted standalone:
const schema = downgradeSchemaV31ToV30({ type: ["string", "null"] });
// { type: "string", nullable: true }
```

## 3.2 → 3.1

Schema Objects pass through unchanged: the 3.2 Schema Object keyword set is identical to 3.1's (3.2 defines its own dialect URI, but only the OAS base vocabulary gained fields), and the 3.2-only fields (discriminator `defaultMapping`, XML `nodeType`) are deliberately retained. Two caveats: the standard OpenAPI 3.1 document schema tolerates them (Schema Object internals are open there), but the strict OAS 3.1 base-vocabulary meta-schema closes the XML and Discriminator Objects to their fixed fields plus `x-`, so a base-vocabulary validator will flag them; and 3.1 tooling will not act on them — in particular a `defaultMapping` fallback stops taking effect (`nodeType` is recovered on the 3.1 → 3.0 hop).

Converted:

| 3.2 construct | 3.1 result |
| --- | --- |
| `openapi: 3.2.x` | `openapi: 3.1.2` |
| `components.mediaTypes` and content-map `$ref`s to them | references inlined, the component map removed; content entries whose reference cannot be inlined (external, unknown, or cyclic targets) are removed, as 3.1 content maps cannot hold references — a parameter or header losing its entire `content` that way is removed with it (3.1 requires exactly one entry there) |
| Media type `itemSchema` without a sibling `schema` | `schema: { type: "array", items: … }` (the 3.2 sequential media type data model) |
| Response `summary` when no `description` exists | promoted to `description` (required in 3.1, so `""` is synthesized as a last resort) |
| Example `dataValue` / `serializedValue` when `value` and `externalValue` are absent | promoted to `value` (in that order) |
| Parameter `style: "cookie"` | removed, letting the 3.1 default `form` apply |

Removed (no 3.1 equivalent): `$self`, server `name`, tag `summary`/`parent`/`kind`, the `query` operation and `additionalOperations` of Path Items, `in: "querystring"` parameters (from parameter lists and `components.parameters`, together with references to the removed component entries, following chains of reference aliases), `allowReserved` on non-query parameters, media type `description`, media type / encoding `prefixEncoding`, `itemEncoding`, and nested `encoding`, a media type `itemSchema` beside an existing `schema`, response `summary` beside an existing `description`, OAuth `deviceAuthorization` flows, and security scheme `oauth2MetadataUrl` and `deprecated`.

Known limitations: security requirements using URI keys and `$self`-relative reference resolution are passed through unchanged.

## 3.1 → 3.0

Converted:

| 3.1 construct | 3.0 result |
| --- | --- |
| `openapi: 3.1.x` | `openapi: 3.0.4` |
| missing `paths` | `{}` (required in 3.0) |
| missing operation `responses` | `{ "default": { "description": "" } }` (required and non-empty in 3.0) |
| Reference `summary` / `description` overrides | removed (3.0 references stand alone) |
| Security requirement roles on non-OAuth schemes | emptied (`[]`) |

Removed (no 3.0 equivalent): `webhooks`, `components.pathItems` (local `$ref`s pointing at it are left untouched and will dangle), `jsonSchemaDialect`, `info.summary`, `license.identifier`, and `mutualTLS` security schemes (reference aliases to them included) — their names are stripped from every security requirement, requirements that referenced only such schemes are removed, and a `security` list emptied that way is removed entirely, since an explicit empty list means "no security required" and would make an operation public.

Schema Objects:

| 3.1 construct | 3.0 result |
| --- | --- |
| `true` / `false` boolean schemas | `{}` / `{ not: {} }` |
| `$ref` with sibling keywords | siblings kept, `$ref` wrapped into `allOf` |
| `type: ["T", "null"]` | `type: "T"` plus `nullable: true` |
| `enum: []` / duplicate `required` entries | `enum` removed / `required` deduplicated (3.0 requires a non-empty `enum` and unique `required`) |
| `type: "null"` | `nullable: true` plus `enum: [null]`; a sibling `enum`/`const` is intersected with the null type — an `enum` containing `null` collapses to `[null]`, and a sibling excluding `null` yields a match-nothing schema (`not: {}`), since the source accepted no value |
| `type` with several non-null entries | `anyOf` of single-type schemas |
| `const` | single-value `enum` |
| numeric `exclusiveMinimum` / `exclusiveMaximum` | bound plus boolean flag (the tighter bound wins) |
| `examples` | first entry becomes `example` when none exists |
| `contentEncoding: base64` | `format: byte` |
| `contentMediaType: application/octet-stream` | `format: binary` |
| `type: "array"` without `items` | `items: {}` is added (required in 3.0) |
| XML `nodeType` (carried over from a 3.2 chain) | `attribute: true` / `wrapped: true` where expressible, then removed (3.0 forbids unknown XML Object fields) |
| `$schema`, `$id`, `$defs`, `$anchor`, `$dynamicRef`/`$dynamicAnchor`, `$vocabulary`, `$comment`, `if`/`then`/`else`, `dependentSchemas`/`dependentRequired`, `prefixItems` (and its trailing `items`), `contains`/`minContains`/`maxContains`, `patternProperties` (and its sibling `additionalProperties`, whose meaning would otherwise tighten onto the pattern-matched keys), `propertyNames`, `unevaluatedItems`/`unevaluatedProperties`, `contentSchema` | removed — in positive schema positions dropping these only loosens validation, the safe direction for a downgrade |

Known limitations: `$ref`s that point into dropped keywords (`#/…/$defs/…` pointers, `$anchor` targets, `$id`-based bases) will dangle — hoist reusable subschemas into `components.schemas` before downgrading. Arbitrary non-standard schema keywords are preserved per the extension-preserving contract, even though the official 3.0 schema forbids unknown Schema Object fields. Dropping keywords inside `not` (where loosening the operand tightens the whole) or inside `oneOf` branches (where loosening one branch can break exclusivity) can shift what validates.
